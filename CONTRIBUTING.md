This document is work in progress.

### Regenerate the configuration with the latest API spec

Use: `./scripts/update_api.sh`. This will update the yaml by pulling those in the [api doc](https://developer.koyeb.com/) and regenerate a client from scratch.
We check in the generated files, please make a separate commit with these.
